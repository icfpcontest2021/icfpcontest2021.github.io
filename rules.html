<section>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        This is an open contest. Anyone may participate in ICFP Programming
        Contest 2021 except for the ICFP 2021 Contest organisers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        No advance registration or entry fee is required.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Contestants are free to organise themselves into teams of any size.  A
        contestant may only be a member of a single team.  Teams may not divide,
        merge, or collaborate after the start of the contest.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Teams are free to use any programming language(s) on any platform(s).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Teams must register during the contest to obtain credentials.  Teams
        using more than one set of credentials during the contest will be
        disqualified.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Teams wishing to be considered for prizes must submit source code at
        the end of the contest.  The exact details of contest submissions will
        be announced at the start of the contest.  Teams may submit multiple
        times during the contest; early submissions may be evaluated during
        the contest for live standings, but only the last submissions for the
        lightning division and the full contest will be considered for prizes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The Organisers retain the right to monitor, record, and investigate
        the submissions, other contest-related activities, or lack thereof, of
        contestants and teams.  The records are used for the sole purpose of
        judgment and are discarded once the contest-related events are over.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Contestants are kindly asked not to attempt to attack the contest
        server. That will spoil the fun for the other teams and the
        Organisers, who worked hard to bring you this experience. Violations
        of these rules, attempts to compromise the integrity of the contest
        infrastructure, attempts to interfere with other contestants, collusion
        between the teams, or attempts to contravene the spirit of the contest
        will lead to disqualification of the involved contestants and/or teams.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Contestants retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in
        and to any submitted solutions, source code, custom tools, and related
        materials (“Submissions”) that contestants had before submission. As
        a condition of submission, contestants grant the Organisers a
        non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license
        to use, reproduce, publish, distribute, publicly perform and publicly
        display the Submissions, allowing the Organisers to test and evaluate
        the Submissions for purposes of the contest.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All decisions of the Organisers are final.
      </p>
