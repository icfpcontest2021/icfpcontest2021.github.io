      <strong>Fri, 30 July 17:45 UTC</strong>
      <p>
  We're excited to announce that we have open sourced the code that we used to
  put together the contest under the BSD3 license.
</p>
<p>
  You can find the code alongside the source for this website at<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/icfpcontest2021/icfpcontest2021.github.io">https://github.com/icfpcontest2021/icfpcontest2021.github.io</a>.

      <p>
  We've sent e-mails notifying the winners. The final scoreboard will be
  reavealed and the winners will be announced at the ICFP conference on August 23-25, 2021.

      <h2 id="014-post-contest-update">Partial scoreboard, poses.live future and Team Writeups</h2>
      <strong>Tue, 13 July 21:00 UTC</strong>
      <p>
  The <a href="scoreboard.html">final scoreboard for the lightning and the full
  division is now available</a>.  Teams with 0 points are not shown, and the top
  15 teams in both rounds have been randomly shuffled, and their score hidden to
  keep some intrigue.  We will get in touch with the winners soon.
</p>
<p>
  Some teams have already posted interesting writeups on how they approached
  the problem.  We started collecting these <a href="writeups.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Several people have asked what will happen to the
  <a href="https://poses.live">poses.live</a> website now that the contest
  is over.  Since there is some interest in keeping it around, the organisers
  will move this to a smaller instance on a personal server.  All data from
  the contest will be wiped, and teams will have to re-register on this new
  instance if they want to continue trying it out.  There will be significant
  downtime this week as we move it.
</p>
<p>
  We will also release source code of the portal and judge after the contest
  presentation at ICFP 2021.  Thanks again to everyone for taking part in this!
